                        me through thick and thin and has always been an
                        inspiration to my sister and I. Since her childhood, she has worked hard to achieve
                        her dreams of being a doctor and has accomplished lots
                        in her lifetime. She truly is one of the most hardworking people I know. Her father pushed her to study hard and become independent 
                        and this helped mould her into the person she is today. Whenever she tells me of how she had ranked low in her first college entrance 
                        exam and then ended up getting into the college she wanted the following year, I can't help but admire her. She has never given up on 
                        anything and always finishes her work wholeheartedly.

                        My mom is passionate about her career and always makes sure that her patients are comfortable under her care. She has an open mind 
                        and is willing to learn new things. Even today she is taking up new courses to educate herself on new developments happening 
                        around the world. Her dedication to her work and future is admirable and motivates me to reach great levels of success. My mom is one 
                        of the most generous people I know and never fails to offer a helping hand to those in need. All these qualitites of her make her 
                        the amazing person she is and I wish for nothing more than to be like her one day. Love you Amma.
