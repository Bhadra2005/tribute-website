# Tribute Website

Tribute website on the person who inspires me the most - my mom.

This is my second ever html-css project.

It's not suited to mobile view yet but I will be working on that and improving it eventually. This project helped me improve my html and css skills and I learnt a lot from researching for it. Excited to work on more projects in the future.
